# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Goals
The Airbnb Clone Project is designed to simulate the development of a real-world booking platform like Airbnb.  
Our goals are to:
- Gain hands-on experience in backend development and database design.
- Build a scalable and secure booking system with modern technologies.
- Strengthen collaboration and workflow management using GitHub.
- Understand how to structure, document, and plan complex software projects.
- Learn how to integrate various tools into a unified development ecosystem.

## Team Roles
Successful project execution depends on different roles working together:

### 1. Project Manager
- Oversees project planning and execution.
- Ensures deadlines and goals are met.
- Facilitates communication between all team members.

### 2. Backend Developer
- Implements server-side logic and RESTful APIs.
- Integrates application with the database and third-party services.
- Ensures performance, scalability, and security.

### 3. Frontend Developer
- Builds the user-facing interface of the platform.
- Ensures responsiveness and seamless user experience.
- Works with backend developers for data consumption.

### 4. Database Administrator (DBA)
- Designs and manages the relational database schema.
- Ensures data integrity, backups, and performance optimization.
- Manages security of stored data.

### 5. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
- Tests application features and identifies bugs.
- Ensures features meet acceptance criteria.
- Automates test cases where possible.

### 6. UI/UX Designer
- Designs intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.
- Conducts usability testing and applies design best practices.
- Maintains design consistency across the platform.

### 7. DevOps Engineer
- Automates deployment using CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitors infrastructure and manages Dockerized environments.
- Ensures high system availability and reliability.

### 8. Business Analyst
- Gathers requirements from stakeholders.
- Translates business goals into technical specifications.
- Ensures alignment between features and business objectives.

## Technology Stack
The project leverages modern technologies for scalability and performance:

- **Django** – Web framework for backend development and API creation.  
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL** – Relational database for managing structured data.  
- **GraphQL** – Efficient query language for APIs, enabling flexible data retrieval.  
- **Docker** – Containerization for consistent environments across development and deployment.  
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD automation for testing and deployment.  
- **Nginx/Gunicorn** – Web server and WSGI server for serving the application.  
- **Redis** – For caching and session management.  

---

## Database Design
The system will use a relational database with the following key entities:

### 1. **Users**
- Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role` (guest/host).  
- Relationships: A user can list multiple properties, make bookings, and leave reviews.

### 2. **Properties**
- Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`, `owner_id`.  
- Relationships: Belongs to a user (host). A property can have multiple bookings and reviews.

### 3. **Bookings**
- Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`, `status`.  
- Relationships: Belongs to both a user (guest) and a property.

### 4. **Reviews**
- Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`.  
- Relationships: Linked to a user and property.

### 5. **Payments**
- Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_status`, `payment_date`.  
- Relationships: Each payment is tied to a specific booking.

## Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone includes the following core features:

### 1. User Management
- User registration, login, and authentication.
- Roles: Guest and Host.
- Profile management and settings.

### 2. Property Management
- Hosts can list properties with details (title, description, price, location, images).
- Ability to edit or remove listings.

### 3. Booking System
- Guests can search and filter properties.
- Book properties for specific dates.
- View booking history and status.

### 4. Reviews and Ratings
- Guests can leave reviews and rate properties.
- Hosts can respond to feedback.
- Ratings displayed on property pages.

### 5. Payment Integration
- Secure payment processing for bookings.
- Support for refunds or cancellations.
- Payment history tracking.

### 6. Search and Filtering
- Users can filter by location, price, availability, and amenities.
- Search results optimized for speed and accuracy.
## API Security

Security is a core part of this project to ensure that data and services remain protected.  
The following measures are implemented:

### 1. Authentication
- All endpoints require valid authentication tokens (JWT or API keys).
- Tokens must be included in the `Authorization` header:
  ```http
  Authorization: Bearer <your-token-here>

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that help automate the software development lifecycle.  

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Ensures that every code change is automatically built, tested, and validated before merging into the main branch.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploys validated code to staging or production environments, reducing manual intervention and ensuring faster delivery.

### Why It’s Important
- **Early Bug Detection:** Code is tested continuously, catching issues before they reach production.  
- **Faster Delivery:** Automating builds and deployments speeds up the release cycle.  
- **Consistency:** Ensures deployments are repeatable and reliable across environments.  
- **Collaboration:** Makes it easier for multiple developers to contribute without breaking the project.  

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions** – Automates workflows like testing, linting, and deployment.  
- **Docker** – Packages applications into containers for consistent deployment.  
- **Jenkins / GitLab CI** – Alternatives for CI/CD pipeline automation.  
- **Kubernetes** – Manages containerized deployments at scale (optional for larger projects).
